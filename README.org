* OB Lobo

** Summary
 - Mathematica is an amazing symbolic execution engine but the notebook
   interface is terrible
 - Emacs org-mode and babel are pretty cool interfaces but lack a good
   execution engine
 - This project tries to bring the two together by transpiling emacs
   lisp code into the wolfram language and running it using ob-mathematica
 - It is in an extremently early stage (I spent roughly two hours on
   it) but already useful to me
 - At some point, I will figure out how to package this up properly
   but for now, you can simply open the [[file:ob-lobo.org]]-file and
   babel-evaluate it (assuming you have loaded ob-mathematica)
 - *Pull requests are very welcome*
